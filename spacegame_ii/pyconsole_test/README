pyconsole version 0.5|
---------------------'


Installation: Unpack tar.gz file.
	If you're going to include this in your own pygame project
	you only need the pyconsole.py file and the fonts directory

Testing:
	Unpack the tar.gz file, cd into the created folder and 
	run "python test.py". This will open a pygame window with 
	a sample pyconsole.
	Type help at the pyconsole for a list of commands

Including the Console in your project:
	To include pyconsole in your game follow these steps:
	1. Configure pyconsole.cfg (or leave it as it is to try out the default config)
	2. import pyconsole to your project
	3. Create a console object by calling pyconsole.Console
	4. In your main loop:
		a. Call console.process_input()
			-Make sure to call it before you process any other input if you've 
			 set preserve_events to True in your pyconsole.cfg. If preserve_events is
			 True and you do not clear the Event Queue your program will hang
			-If the console is active, any key events will be caught by the console
			 and processed, if it isn't process_input() will do nothing and return.
		b. Call console.draw()
			-If the console is active this will draw the console to the screen,
			 otherwise it wont do anything.
	
	
Using the console:
	Command Syntax:
		<command-name> <arg1> <arg2> <arg3> ... <argn>
		ex: "help clear" prints the help information for the function clear
		
	Variable Syntax:
		$<variable-name>
		$<variable-name> = <value>
		ex: $x 				Just print the value of x
			$x = 100		Set x equal to 100
		

The test program should make most of this clear
